# blockcraft-vault

Blockcraft Vault is my app for keeping private information such as encryption keys secure, private and anonymous through the use of a zero-knowledge encryption scheme. The server never sees or stores your unhashed user id and password, or your unencrypted data. Moreover, the hashed password will not decrypt the data. It is ideal for such use cases as a blockchain wallet, blockchain voting ballot and beyond.
