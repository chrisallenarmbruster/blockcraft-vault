# blockcraft-vault
Blockcraft Vault is an app to keep private information such as encryption keys secure, private and anonymous through the use of a zero-knowlege encryption scheme.  The server never sees or stores your unhashed user id, password and data.  It is ideal for such use cases as a blockchain wallet, blockchain voting ballot and many other use cases.
